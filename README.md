## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Install the required R packages if not already present:
```r
install.packages(c("quantmod", "PerformanceAnalytics", "tidyverse", "zoo", "lubridate", "ggplot2", "xts"))


üî∂ 1. Golden Cross / Death Cross Strategy (TCS) Indicators Used:

SMA50 (50-day Simple Moving Average)

SMA200 (200-day Simple Moving Average)

Logic:

A Golden Cross occurs when SMA50 crosses above SMA200 ‚Üí Signal to buy

A Death Cross occurs when SMA50 crosses below SMA200 ‚Üí Signal to sell

Visualization:

Line plot with SMA50, SMA200, and close price

Green upward arrows for Golden Cross

Red downward arrows for Death Cross

üî∂ 2. Bollinger Bands Strategy (AAPL) Indicators Used:

SMA20 (20-day Simple Moving Average)

Upper/Lower Bands: SMA ¬± 2√ó standard deviation

Logic:

Buy when the price hits the lower band

Sell when the price hits the upper band

Visualization:

Price chart with Bollinger Bands

Green arrow for buy signal at the lower band

Red arrow for sell signal at the upper band

üî∂ 3. Simulated Data Bollinger Band Strategy Purpose: Backtest mean reversion on a simulated price series

Method:

Generated synthetic stock data using normal returns

Applied Bollinger Bands (20-day SMA ¬± 2 std dev)

Generated buy/sell signals similarly as above

Visualization:

Candlestick-style price chart with bands and shaded area

Buy/Sell signals marked with arrows

üî∂ 4. RSI Strategy (TCS) Indicator Used:

RSI (Relative Strength Index) with a period of 14

Logic:

Buy when RSI < 30 (oversold)

Sell when RSI > 70 (overbought)

Visualization:

RSI line with horizontal lines at 30 and 70

Green arrow for buy

Red arrow for sell

üî∂ 5. Breakout Strategy with Volume Confirmation (TCS) Indicators Used:

20-day High

20-day Average Volume

Logic:

A breakout buy is triggered when:

Current close > 20-day high

Current volume > 1.5√ó 20-day average volume

Visualization:

Close price line

Volume as bars

Green arrow for breakout signals
